A unique pomodoro timer for studying 

The Fall Focus Pomodoro Timer is a cozy, autumn-hued productivity application that I created to remain organized and motivated during grade 10. The burden of work this year has been overwhelming, and I find myself constantly switching between assignments, tests, and club tasks.I created this project for productivity and make studying  more chill and enjoyable.

I wrote it in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML supplied the structure, CSS created the warm, autumn vibe , and JavaScript enabled the timer controlling the start, pause, and reset functions. I also added relaxing background music that plays whenever you click anywhere on the screen, so the atmosphere is relaxed and focused. The aesthetic is designed to feel like your sitting in a warm café surrounded by leaves. 
The purpose behind this project is simple: I wanted to do more without overwhelming myself.. Making this also educated me on how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript overlap to make an entire interactive project, and learned how to make something useful while retaining creativity.
The Fall Focus Pomodoro Timer is more than just a timer — it's a reminder to slow down, stay focused, and enjoy the process, even when life gets hectic.
